<H1>Simple Accounts module help (V 1.0)</H1>
<P><I>(c) 2004-2005 Ashley Kitson, UK. This document and associated
program works are licensed under the GNU General Public License
Version 2</I> 
</P>
<P>This is the help file. For Class and Functions declarations see
the <A HREF="../docu/index.html" TARGET="_blank">Systems
Documentation</A></P>
<P>The Simple Accounts module (or SACC) is a building block module
that is aimed at assisting Xoops business systems developers. 
</P>
<H2>Background</H2>
<P>Many business systems (and other non-business ones) are required
to account for financial value in some manner. This module is aimed
at providing double entry book-keeping facilities for Xoops business
systems developers. Although it can be used by itself, that is not
it's real aim. 
</P>
<P>SACC provides the following functionality; 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Multi organisation accounting
	(accounts for &gt;1 organisation can be kept in the same system,
	thus once the module is installed, many applications can use it.) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Basic on screen journal entry of
	accounts. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hierarchical accounts 
	</P>
	<LI><P>A program API based on xoopsObject that can easily extended
	for additional application functionality 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2>Installing SACC</H2>
<P>Installing SACC is as straightforward as installing any other
Xoops module. However you <STRONG>MUST install Code Data Management
(CDM) first</STRONG>. You can download that module in the same place
that you found SACC. However, please note that SACC V1.0 requires CDM V1.5 or better. SACC relies on CDM to provide some of its
functionality and ancestor object class structure. Simply unpack the
archive file into a directory called 'xbs_sacc' in your Xoops module
directory. Then install as for any other module using the Xoops
administration-modules functionality. There is little or no
configuration to be done. The installation process loads default sets
of codes for SACC into CDM.  1 /SACCACTP - Account Types, 2 /SACCCNTL
- Control Account names. 
</P>
<P>By default the module is available to the administrator and
registered users group. You can of course give access to other groups
if required. 
</P>
<H2>Concepts</H2>
<P>It is important to understand a few concepts about SACC before
beginning to use it. 
</P>
<P><I>SACC employs a hierarchy of data;</I><BR>Organisation 1-n
Account 1-n Account Entry (Or each Organisation can have many
Accounts and each Account can have many Entries.) 
</P>
<P>Account Entries are controlled by Journal Entries<BR>Organisation
1-n Journal Entries 1-n Account Entry (Or an Organisation can have
many Journal Entries which provides a unifying wrapper for a set of
Account Entries.) 
</P>
<P>As long as you use the facilities provided by the built in user
interface or the programming API, you will acheive balanced double
entry accounting. 
</P>
<P><I>Data is never deleted.</I>Technically, you shouldn't delete an
account entry anyway (you should make a reversing entry.) However,
future versions of SACC will allow you to 'defunct' an entry, thereby
removing it from calculation of balances etc. Most list screens show
a record 'Row Flag'. This is set to 'Active' by default. In future
this may be set to 'Suspended' or 'Defunct'. A 'Suspended' record is
out of use temporarily and can revert to 'Active'. A 'Defunct' record
is out of use permanently. 
</P>
<P>In addition to recorded the record status, the system also records
the name of the last user to edit data and the date and time. This
can be used for auditing purposes. You cannot see these at present
unless you use a SQL tool such as phpMyAdmin to inspect the
underlying tables. 
</P>
<H2>Using SACC - Interactive use</H2>
<H3>Administration tasks</H3>
<P>There are a number of tasks that you need to undertake before your
users can start using SACC, or before you can start programming your
application to use it. These consist of 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Basic SACC configuration 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Create an Organisation 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Add accounts for an organisation 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>All of these tasks are accomplished from the SACC module
administration screen. Log on as adminsitrator and access the module
admin screen as per normal for Xoops.<BR>The module configuration
screen has two tabs, Organisation and Account. More of these later.
At the top of the screen are 4 links. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Module Configuration. This takes
	you to the CDM screen to edit the SACCxxx code entries that are used
	to configure SACC. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Module Home Page. This takes you
	to the SACC first page (Select organisation) on the user side. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Module Documentation. Presents
	phpMydoc system documentation for the SACC API 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Module Support. Takes you to the internet home page for SACC
	support 
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>Configuration</H4>
<P>User definable configuration for the module is done via the normal
module configuration screen Access this by clicking Module
Configuration from the SACC admin screen.</P>
<P>Other configuration is via the CDM menu entry on the user menu..
Browse the code sets for SACC and edit entries as required. The code
sets are; 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1 SACCACTP - Account Types, 
	</P>
	<LI><P>2 SACCCNTL - Control Account names. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Other constant definitions are in the normal language/../main.php
file. 
</P>
<P><I>Organisations.</I> Click the Organisation tab. On first use,
the list will be empty, so the screen will display an organisation
details input form. Add the name of your organisation. When you click
'Submit', you will go back to the Organisation choice screen.
Creating an organisation also creates a simple skeleton account tree
for it, comprising of an Asset, Liability, Income, Expense and Equity
Master accounts along with two other accounts, the Bank account and
the Opening Balances account. Every new Organisation gets these
accounts. A future version of SACC will allow you to choose a more
complex template to initially populate your accounts list with. Note
that the Bank and Opening Balances accounts are indented beneath
their respective parent accounts. You can edit an existing
organisation from this screen as well. Please bear in mind that if
you &quot;defunct&quot; an organisation, the system will also defunct
all of its accounts as well. 
</P>
<P><I>Accounts. </I>When you first click on the Account tab, you are
requested to choose an organisation to work with. When you have
chosen one, the list of accounts for that organisation is displayed
and you are asked to select one to edit. ALternatively you can insert
a new account into the tree. To create a new account, click on the
Insert button. Give the account a name and select the type of account
you want. The 'Bank' and 'Customer' account types are special forms
of Asset accounts, whilst the Supplier account is a special form of a
Liability account. These three special types will, in a future
release allow users to enter additional address and reference data
for the accounts (e.g. Bank account number etc.) You should select
them if required to take advantage of future functionality. (e.g. if
you want to set up an account to record a loan, use the Supplier
Account type so that in future you can record details of the
loan.)<BR>Next, you need to select the parent account of this new
account. Leaving it as 'No Parent' is not usually an option except
under special circumstances, so choose Asset, Liability, Income,
Expense or Equity as the parent account. You can choose an account
that you previously set up. For instance, create an account called
'Loans' with Liability as its parent. Then create an account called
'Car Loan' with Loans as its parent and so on.<BR>The 'Account
Purpose' text box allows you to put a description of the account that
will display in the list of accounts (user side). 'Account Notes'
allows you to enter additional information but this is not displayed
in the list of accounts screen.<BR>The 'Row Flag' selection box
allows you to set the row status for the account. By default this is
'Active' and means that the account is useable. You can temporarily
'Suspend' an account. This means that you will not be able to post
transactions against it. Suspended accounts will also be updated as a
result of child account entries. A Suspended account can be made
active again. To 'Defunct' an account, it must first have a zero
balance and usually this means that you must post a journal entry to
zero the balance away from the account or one of its children. A
Defunct account cannot be made Active again. Defunct accounts cannot
be posted against and will not be updated as a result of a posting to
a child account (by definition child accounts are also
Defunct.)<BR>Click 'Submit' to save the account details. 
</P>
<H3>User Tasks</H3>
<P>All user tasks are accessed from the user side menu.
<I>Organisations.</I> Go to your site main page and click on the
'Simple Accounts' menu item. You now have the opportunity to choose
the Organisation that you wish to work with in this session. The
screen changes to show the accounts list for your organisation. The
accounts list shows debit and credit totals with a balance of the two
(according to accepted accounting principles.) You can redisplay the
account list by clicking on the 'List of Accounts' menu item. Change
the organisation that you want to work with using the 'Simple
Accounts' menu item again. 
</P>
<P><I>Accounts.</I> 'List of Accounts' menu item to view the accounts
tree for your current organisation. From this screen you can view any
entries on an account by clicking teh browse button next to the
required account. Note that parent accounts do not normally have
entries in them, there balances being derived from child accounts. 
</P>
<P><I>Journal Entries. </I>Click the 'Enter Journal' menu option to
make an entry into your accounts system. Enter the purpose of the
entry. This will display in the 'List of Journals' screen. Select the
debit and credit accounts and optionally enter a reference for each
that will appear in the account entry screen. Enter the amount of the
transaction and click on the 'Submit' button to commit the
transaction. The screen will then display the list of journal entries
for your accounts. This screen can also be reached via the 'List of
Journals' menu option. At present you cannot do much from the 'List
Journals' screen. Future versions of SACC will allow you to review
the account entries for the journal and reverse the journal etc. If
you return to the 'List of Accounts' screen via the menu, you will
see that your accounts have been updated and that balances have been
'bubbled up' from child accounts to their parents. 
</P>
<P>Hopefully the screens are easy enough to navigate. Click the
Browse icon next to a record to see the entries associated with it.
Click the edit button for a record to go to its full details and to
make changes. The record isnert button is usually above any list
display. 
</P>
<H2>The API</H2>
<P>The real utility of SACC comes when you incorporate it into your
own module. You need to do a few simple things to access SACC. 
</P>
<P>In the <B>header.php</B> script of your own module add the
following line after your include to mainfile.php; 
</P>
<P>require_once XOOPS_ROOT_PATH.&quot;/modules/sacc/include/defines.php&quot;;
</P>
<P>If you want to use the built in xoopsForm extensions for Account
Types, Control Accounts, Organisations, Accounts and Parent Accounts
in a form generation page include the following line somewhere at the
head of your script; 
</P>
<P>require_once SACC_PATH.&quot;/class/class.sacc.form.php&quot;; 
</P>
<P>Read the class.sacc.form.php for calling parameters to these
extension objects. 
</P>
<P>To use the function layer supplied with SACC, you will need to
have the following line before calling them; 
</P>
<P>require_once SACC_PATH.&quot;/include/functions.php&quot;; <I>The
functions.</I> The functions included in the functions.php file are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">getErrNo
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">getErrMsg
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">formatMoney
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">createOrg

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">getControlAccount
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">initializeJournal
	</P>
	<LI><P>saveJournal
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Read the functions.php file for more information and access the
<A HREF="../docu/index.html" TARGET="_blank">Systems
Documentation</A>. 
</P>
<P>If you want to do something more complex you will need to use the
SACC objects with their associated handlers directly. The class tree
for these objects is: 
</P>
<P>XoopsObject<BR>---&gt; CDMBaseObject<BR>--------&gt;
Account<BR>------------&gt; SACCDRAccount<BR>-----------------&gt;
SACCExpenseAc<BR>-----------------&gt;
SACCAssetAc<BR>---------------------&gt;
SACCCustomerAc<BR>--------------------------&gt;
SACCBankAc<BR>------------&gt; SACCCRAccount<BR>-----------------&gt;
SACCIncomeAc<BR>-----------------&gt;
SACCLiabilityAc<BR>----------------------&gt;
SACCSupplierAc<BR>----------------------&gt; SACCEquityAc<BR>--------&gt;
AcEntry<BR>--------&gt; Journal<BR>--------&gt;
SACCControl<BR>--------&gt; Org</P>
<P>XoopsObjectHandler<BR>---&gt; CDMBaseHandler<BR>--------&gt;
SaccSACCOrgHandler<BR>--------&gt; SaccSACCAccountHandler<BR>--------&gt;
SaccSACCJournalHandler<BR>--------&gt; SaccSACCEntryHandler<BR>--------&gt;
SaccSACCControlHandler</P>
<P>To use these objects you create a handler object and then ask it
to create or get the data object e.g.; 
</P>
<P>NB SACC_DIR is a constant set in defines.php and must be used in
calls to xoops_getModuleHandler<BR>$setHandler =&amp;
xoops_getModuleHandler(ObjName,SACC_DIR) where ObjName is one of
&quot;Org&quot;, &quot;Account&quot;, &quot;Journal&quot;,
&quot;SACCEntry&quot; or &quot;SACCControl&quot;;<BR>$obj =&amp;
$setHandler-&gt;get($id);<BR>$obj2 =&amp; $setHandler-&gt;create(); 
</P>
<P>You are advised to read the class files in the class sub directory
for further guidance. Beware, that under normal circumstances, you
should avoid using the &quot;getall&quot; methods of the handler
objects as they will return all data (suspended and defunct) which is
not usually what you require. Use the &quot;get&quot; method. 
</P>
<P><I>Control accounts.</I> When a new organisation is set up, along
with the skeleton chart of accounts, two entries are made in the
control accounts table. These are BANK and OPEN. The entries here
point to the actual accounts for Bank Account and Opening Balances
account respectively. Thus an application can find these two accounts
for an organisation without having to know the actual account ids
(for instance a payments system will need to know the bank account
details to make payments.) Use the getControlAccount function to
retrieve a control account id. 
</P>
<P><I>Storage of monetary values</I>. SACC stores all monetary vales
(debit, credit, net balances etc) internally as an integer. Thus
&Acirc;&pound;123.07 is stored internally as 12307. This is due to
some problems that a/ PHP has in handling real numbers and 2/ float
conversion issues between PHP and MySQL. Therefore you need to
convert such values to real values to display them, and similarly
convert any value entered by users to an integer before putting it
into a SACC object (and ultimately the database.) 
</P>
<P>To do this use the following constructs that make use of the
SACC_CFG_DECPNT constant, the value for which is set in the module
configuration administration screen. Note also the use of the
formatMoney function.</P>
<P>Displaying data, as in this example which is preparing account
data for display via a Xoops Smarty Template. Taken from
sacc_accounts_list.php</P>
<P><A NAME="DDE_LINK1"></A>include_once
CDM_DIR.&quot;/include/functions.php&quot;<BR>...<BR>$accounts =
$org-&gt;getAccounts();<BR>$decpnt = pow(10,SACC_CFG_DECPNT);<BR>foreach
($accounts as $acc) {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;$acc[&quot;ac_dr&quot;] =
formatMoney($acc[&quot;ac_dr&quot;] / $decpnt);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;$acc[&quot;ac_cr&quot;]
= formatMoney($acc[&quot;ac_cr&quot;] /
$decpnt);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;$acc[&quot;ac_net_bal&quot;] =
formatMoney($accs&quot;ac_net_bal&quot;] /
$decpnt);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;$xoopsTpl-&gt;append(&quot;accounts&quot;,$acc);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</P>
<P>Writing data to object, as in the following example from
sacc_journal.php which writes journal entries to the journal object</P>
<P>require_once CDM_DIR.&quot;/include/functions.php&quot;<BR>...<BR>$jData
= $jHandler-&gt;create($dte,$jrn_prps,$_SESSION['sacc_org_id']);<BR>$amount
*= pow(10,SACC_CFG_DECPNT); //convert float to
integer<BR>$jData-&gt;appendEntry($ac_dr_id,$dr_ref,$amount,0);<BR>$jData-&gt;appendEntry($ac_cr_id,$cr_ref,0,$amount);</P>
<P>N.B. There is nothing to stop you appending more than 2 entries to
a journal, so multi line journal entries are possible. It is up to
you to make sure that the debits and credits balance though! 
</P>
<P>Access the SACC system documentation via the administration
screen. 
</P>
<H2>Future Development</H2>
<P>SACC is intended as a tool for developers. It is not meant to be a
full blown accounting system, although it is possible from these
humble beginnings to create one. SACC will never therefore be a
replacement for GNUCash for instance. However, the following
developments are planned for SACC and will be released given the time
to do them. 
</P>
<P>V0.1 - Basic functionality. Really a preview for others to see
essential features via the built in user entry screens<BR>V0.2 -
Creation of programmatic functions to access system functionality.
This will be a function layer over the object layer to carry out
common tasks such as creating journals, getting account balances,
getting organisation ids etc.<BR>V0.3 - Move account and organisation
creation and editing to Xoops module administration screens. This
will leave account listing, journal listing and journal creation and
editing on the 'user' side.<BR>V1.0 – (<B><I>This release.</I></B>)
Move SACC configuration into normal admin side config screens.  This
is the first full release of SACC that has core functionality
complete.  Everything else after this is  add-on.<BR>V1.1 - All about
journals. Reversal of journals. Defuncting of journals. Allow &gt;2
line entry of journals (NB, this is possible programmatically
already, just not in the input screen of the V1.0 system.)<BR>V1.2 -
All about organisations. Allow selection of account template to apply
to new organisation. Admin facilities to create account templates.
Creation of VAT accounts on organisation create.<BR>V1.3 - Reporting.
P/L and Balance Sheet Reports. These reports will be from templates
which can then be copied on an Organisation by Organisation basis and
modified by the administrator.<BR>V1.4 - Extension of Supplier,
Customer and Bank account type objects to include address details and
banking details (for Bank.)<BR>V1.5 - Export and import facilities
to/from GNUCash<BR>V1.6 - Anything else that crops up!<BR>V1.0 - Full
release. 
</P>
<P>Obviously this takes some effort, so any interested developers out
there who'd like to lend a hand are more than welcome to join in via
the Xoops Dev Site. 
</P>
<H2>Getting help and reporting bugs</H2>
<P>The code for this module is maintained via the <A HREF="http://dev.xoops.org/modules/xfmod/project/?sacc">Xoops
Development</A> facility. Use the facilities there to report and
track bugs and get latest downloads. Demo and support facilities are
kept on my own <A HREF="http://xoobs.net/">website</A> 
</P>
<H2>Acknowledgements</H2>
<P>Thanks to various people on the Xoops dev and support forums who
by solving problems before me, made this a slightly less painful
exercise than could have been :-)<BR>Thanks also to the phpMyAdmin
team who made using MySql easy (and who I nicked the icons off but I
can't find the right person to thank so I'm saying it here.)
